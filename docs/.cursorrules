# Coding Agent Instructions for fund78 Project

## Project Context
This is a Go (Golang) project named `fund78`. The project is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Language and Framework
- **Primary Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Minimum Go Version:** 1.21
- **Module Name:** fund78

## Code Style and Standards

### General Guidelines
- Follow Go best practices and idiomatic Go code patterns
- Use `gofmt` for code formatting (standard Go formatting)
- Prefer explicit error handling over ignoring errors
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- **DO NOT add any comments to the code - code only, no comments**

### Naming Conventions
- Use `camelCase` for local variables and functions
- Use `PascalCase` for exported functions, types, and constants
- Use short, descriptive names (e.g., `ctx` for context, `db` for database)
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely understood

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Return errors as the last return value
- Use `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` verb to wrap errors for error context
- Provide meaningful error messages

### Code Organization
- Place main entry points in `cmd/` directory
- Keep internal code in `internal/` directory
- Shareable packages go in `pkg/` directory
- Test files should be in the same package with `_test.go` suffix

## File Structure Preferences

When creating new files:
- Create appropriate directory structure before adding files
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns (handlers, services, models, etc.)
- Keep main.go simple, delegate to other packages

## Dependencies

### Adding Dependencies
- Use `go get` for adding dependencies
- Pin versions appropriately
- Document why a dependency is needed
- Prefer standard library over external packages when possible
- Review and minimize dependency count

### Common Libraries (if needed)
- Use standard library when possible
- For HTTP: `net/http` (standard library)
- For JSON: `encoding/json` (standard library)
- For testing: `testing` (standard library)

## Testing

### Test Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all exported functions
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage
- Place test files alongside source code with `_test.go` suffix
- Use descriptive test function names: `TestFunctionName_Scenario`

### Test Examples
```go
func TestFunction_WithValidInput_ReturnsExpectedResult(t *testing.T) {
}
```

## Documentation

### Comments
- **NEVER add comments to code - write only code, no comments whatsoever**
- Code should be self-documenting through clear naming

### README Updates
- Update README.md when adding significant features
- Include usage examples
- Document any required environment variables or configuration

## Security

### Best Practices
- Never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate and sanitize all input
- Use context for request cancellation and timeouts

## Performance

### Considerations
- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Use `context.Context` for cancellation and timeouts
- Consider concurrency when appropriate (goroutines, channels)

## When Making Changes

1. **Before implementing:**
   - Understand the existing code structure
   - Check if similar functionality already exists
   - Consider backward compatibility

2. **While implementing:**
   - Write tests alongside code
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Keep changes focused and small when possible

3. **After implementing:**
   - Run `go fmt ./...` to format code
   - Run `go vet ./...` to check for common errors
   - Run tests: `go test ./...`
   - Check for linter errors
   - Update documentation if needed

## Common Commands

```bash
# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Build the project
go build

# Run the application
go run main.go

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Check for issues
go vet ./...
```

## Project-Specific Notes

- The project is currently in early development
- Structure and patterns may evolve as requirements become clearer
- When in doubt, prefer simplicity and clarity over cleverness
- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
